# Journey
## Mixed Messages Project

A simple program that prints a random set of messages to the console, giving the user a spirit animal, telling them where they are in their journey, and what action they should consider taking next.

## Technologies

1. JavaScript
2. Visual Studio Code
3. Git & GitHub
4. The Console

## Launch

+ Make sure you have node.js installed on your machine.
+ Download the files from the [mixed messages repository](https://github.com/petebyrne/mixedMessages.git) on GitHub.
+ From the command line, navigate to the directory that now contains 'script.js'.
+ Run the file by typing **node script.js**

You should then see 3 lines of text explaining your randomly created journey.
